I received my B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from [Department of Engineering Mechanics, School of Aerospace](http://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html), in 2013 and 2019, respectively. 
My Ph.D. supervisors are Prof. [Zeng-Yuan Guo](http://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/hy/1734/2010/20101219161553483356016/20101219161553483356016_.html) and Prof. [Qun Chen](http://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/hy/1734/2010/20101215161155869115549/20101215161155869115549_.html).
Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Naoki Shikazono's Lab, Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo.

My research interests focus on the heat transfer phenomena and the modeling and optimization of energy systems. I am also interested in topics in classical and modern thermodynamics. Currently, I am majorly working on the simulation of frost growth using the phase-field method.

My detailed Curriculum Vitae is available [here](cv_zhaotian_en.pdf).
