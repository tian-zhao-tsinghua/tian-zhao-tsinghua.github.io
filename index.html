<p>I received my B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from <a href="http://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Department of Engineering Mechanics, School of Aerospace</a>, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html">Tsinghua University</a>, in 2013 and 2019, respectively.
My Ph.D. supervisors are Prof. <a href="http://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/hy/1734/2010/20101219161553483356016/20101219161553483356016_.html">Zeng-Yuan Guo</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/hy/1734/2010/20101215161155869115549/20101215161155869115549_.html">Qun Chen</a>.
Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Naoki Shikazono's Lab, Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>My research interests focus on the heat transfer phenomena and the modeling and optimization of energy systems. I am also interested in topics in classical and modern thermodynamics. Currently, I am majorly working on the simulation of frost growth using the phase-field method.</p>
